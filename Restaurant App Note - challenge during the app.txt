problem when deploy to google cloud.

1. data base script need to change to small case
   ex: Table Orders -> orders
   ex: Table Users -> users


cause: it might because google cloud use linux. It is case sensitive
so I create a new script only for linux O.S



2.deploy to google cloud with bare computing and install java. It finish starting process for 30 minutes. (This spend me from March 5 - 6, 2018) - debugging this for 14 hours. Because I always closed it before it finish its starting process.

How I solved it : I deploy simple spring app to GCE first and it doesn’t take that long. So we know it is my app’s problem


3.Setting up firewall rule. The tomcat is waiting for 8080. It is running inside the GCE. 
but external client still cannot request webpage from google external IP
